### Day 8: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Included the translation page, had some problems with the borders of header and footer, because of the W3C.css inclusion in this page.

**Thoughts:** Working in the ICE is not that bad at all.

### Day 9: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I solved the problem with the borders. Only the last end of the footer does not what it should.

**Thoughts:** Working with others frameworks is sometimes more work than working out everything by myself.
