## *Projects I want to do within the 100 days of code*

# make my own Website new and great (HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the planning ahead as well)
- https://www.shidigital.com (the old one)

- make a live test in different Browsers, Screensizes, etc. with the finished homepage

- include existing Translation Page
- build SEO Page
- build Webdev Page

- build About page
- build Contact Page

- build every other page needed, one at a time
- improve Layout and Look where needed
- make it responsive


*Done:*
- planning of the Sitemap
- planning of the Layout
- planning of the ColorScheme/Font/Look

- make a basic Mockup in HTML and CSS
- build a proper Header, Navigation and Footer (The Elements that all pages will have in common)
