## Projects I want to do within the 100 days of code

- make my own Website new and great (HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the planning ahead as well)
--> https://www.shidigital.com (the old one)




- make a simple game with JavaScript
- go on with EloquentJavascript and/or freeCodeCamp-Projects (tutorials only in work shifts)
