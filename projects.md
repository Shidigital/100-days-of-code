## *Projects I want to do within the 100 days of code*

## make my own Website new and great (HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the planning ahead as well)
- https://www.shidigital.com (the old one)
- I chose to not use any framework for performance reasons and so I need to learn how everything works by myself

*To-Do:*
- planning of the ColorScheme/Font/Look
- build a proper Header, Navigation and Footer (The Elements that all pages will have in common)
- build the Homepage
- build every other page needed, one at a time
- improve Layout and Look where needed
- make it responsive


*Done:*
- planning of the Sitemap
- planning of the Layout
- make a basic Mockup in HTML and CSS


# make a simple game with JavaScript
# go on with EloquentJavascript and/or freeCodeCamp-Projects (tutorials only in work shifts)
